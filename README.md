A script which transforms a dictionary from markdown to JSON.

```
node index.js <a path to a dictionary markdown file> <a path to a CSV file with roots>
```

The script parses the given markdown file and produces the following files:
- `unparseable.json`, rows which were not parsed to a entry or link
- `dictionary.json`, all parsed entries with merged links
- `broken.json`, incorrectly parsed entreis by error type: amplified meanings, unparseable forms, or unparseable derived forms, unmatched derived forms
- `duplicates.json`, a collection of duplicate lemmata with counts
- `unmatched-roots.json`, a list of roots which did not match any entry
- `unparseable-links.json`, rows which were recognized as links but did not have a valid target
- `links.json`, all parsed links
- `broken-links.json`, a subset of parsed links which did not have a matching entry

## Input

### Dictionary

The dictionary is a markdown file with rows containing an entry `**<lemma>** <optional homonym><optional forms after a comma> <meaning><optional nested meanings of fucntions or confugations><optinal derived starting with \>><optinal derived from starting with \<>` or a link `<comma separated list of lemmata marked with **> <optionak etc.> \*cf.\* <list lemmata similar to derived forms>`. Empty lines are ignored.

Conjugation identfiers are: `G`, `Gtn`, `Gt`, `D`, `Dtn`, `Dt`, `Dtt`, `≈†`, `≈†tn`, `≈†t`, `≈†D`, `N`, `Ntn`, `R`.

Function identifiers are: `A.`, `B.`,  `C.`, ...

Entry identifiers are: `1.`, `2.`,  `3.`, ...

In the markdown the identifiers are bolded, e.g. `**G**`.

Logograms are identified by `\[` and `\]`.

### Roots

The roots file should be a CSV file with two columns. The first colum should contain the unexpanded lemma and optional homonym numbers and the second column should contain the root.

## Output

After the parsing a summary of results is displayed:
```
‚ùå <number of unparseable rows (entries + links)>
üîó <number of parsed links>  üöß <number of links with incorrectly parsed targets>
‚úîÔ∏è <number of parsed entries>  üöß <number of broken entries> üí• <number of duplicate lemmata> ‚ùì <number of unmatched roots>
```

The dictionary is parsed to a JSON file containing an array of entries:
```
{
  "lemma": "<lemma splitted to components with mardown and * removed>",
  "attested": <false is lemma starts with *, true otherwise>,
  "legacyLemma": <unprocessed lemma from the original row>
  "homonym: "<homonym or I if not specified>",
  "forms": <array of forms and expanded lemma or an empty array if none specified>,
  "meaning": "<meaning>",
  "amplifiedMeanings": <amplified meadings or an empty object of not specified>,
  "logograms": <an array of logogram entries separated semicolons extracted from meaning and amplified meanings>,
  "derived": <array of derived words or an empty empty array if none specified>,
  "derivedFrom": "<derived from or null is not specified>",
  "source": "<the original row>",
  "root": <the root if matching row was found in the roots CSV>,
  "pos": <V if the rood was added>
}
```

Forms have the following structure:
```
{
  "lemma": "<lemma splitted to components with mardown removed>",
 
}
```

Amplified meanings have the following structure:
```
{
  "implicit": <a map of entries if no top level identifier was specified>,
  "<function or conjugation identifier>": <an entry>,
  "<function or conjugation identifier>": <an entry>,
  ...
}
```

Entries have the following structure:
```
{
  "meaning": <a common meaning of function or conjugation if specified see format below>
  "<entry id>": {
    "meaning": "<meaning>",
    "vowels": [
      {
        "value": [<first vowel>, <second vowel>],
        "notes": <an array of extra information>
      }
    ],
    "entries": <an array of entries, only on top level>
  },
  ...
}
```

Logograms entrries have the following structure:
```
{
  "logogram": <an array of expanded logogram variations>,
  "notes": <an array of extra information>
}
```

Derived words have the following structure:
```
{
  "lemma": "<lemma splitted to components with mardown removed>",
  "homonym: "<homonym or I if not specified>,
  "notes": <an array of extra information e.g. cf. or ?>,
  "source": <if entry was created due to a link the original row of the link>
}
```

Derived from has the following structure:
```
{
  "lemma": "<lemma splitted to components with mardown removed>",
  "homonym: "<homonym or I if not specified>",
  "notes": <an array of extra information>
}
```

## Link merging

Lemmata from links are added as derived forms to words defined by the list after `\*cf.*\`. The derived from will use the notes from the link and has additional `source` property containing the original row of the link.

If link and target lemmata end with `...` a derived form is added where the prefix target lemma is replaced with the prefix of the link lemma.

## Lemma expansion rules

* A lemma with parentheses is expanded to a lemma without and a lemma with the contents of the parenteses. E.g. `mal√ª(m)` -> `mal√ª` and `mal√ªm`.
* A lemma ending with `-um` is expanded to two lemmata ending with `-u` and `-um`. E.g. `mƒÅmil≈´tum` -> `mƒÅmil≈´tu` and `mƒÅmil≈´tum`
* A lemma ending with `-√ªm` is expanded to two lemmata ending with `-√ª` and `-√ªm`
* In the case of multiple parentheses and/or `-um` all combinations are expanded.
